##Project Background

Below is the fictional project background for applying all the project management concepts and procedure for a project.

The current procedure of procurement is manual and tedious which impacts performance between CT
Electronics and its suppliers. This project aims at facilitating procurement by development of a web portal
which will automate communication between CT Electronics and its top 250 suppliers by sales. The project
also includes EDI enhancements, directing new feeds to ERP and Warehousing Systems, non-conforming
queue development and enhancement of the receiving and put away process. This will reduce friction in the
current order life cycle and supply chain, thereby lowering costs and improving customer and operational
service.
